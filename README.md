# DVD burner add-on for Kodi
Kodi is a free and open source media player software (https://kodi.tv) based on the former XBMC project. 
Currently Kodi lacks the ability to archive video files and burn them to external discs.
This kind of functionality would be difficult to make cross-platform, due to the lack of 
open tools that would be needed for Microsoft Windows. Another challenge is the number of
dependencies that are needed, which might mean trouble for OpenELEC.
This is some quick hacking around and is very much a slow work in progress.
To install, click the "Download ZIP" button on this page
and copy it to your KODI box.
